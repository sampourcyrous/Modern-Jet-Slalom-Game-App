Instead of following one tutorial, I created my game by combining multiple functionalities from these tutorials.
Here are the following functionalities of the game:
	- I added an infinite terrain
	- The accelerometer moves the jet side to side
	- Pyramids are randomly placed ahead of the jet as the jet moves forward
	- Collision detection is added and if that event occurs, the game is over

Open CSC490 Game 1 in unity. You can play the game on unity itself by clicking the play button, but since this is a
mobile game, you need the accelerometer to move the plane sideways.
In order to use the phone's accerlerometer follow these steps:
	- Download unity remote on your mobile device
	- Once downloaded, open the unity remote app on the mobile device
	- Connect the mobile device to the computer
	- Press play on unity on the desktop while the unity remote app is running on the mobile device
	- After a few seconds, the app should be displayed on the mobile device and the accelerometer should be working
	  when you tilt the phone which moves the jet in the game
	- the quality of the game won't be good since you are running it in real time using this method

I have only tested this on an iPhone 6. It should work with android but I have not tested it. If you have any problems
running the game, I have a working built version on my phone you can see just in case
