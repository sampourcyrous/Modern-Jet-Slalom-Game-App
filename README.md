# Modern Jet Slalom Game App

Here are the following functionalities of the game:
	- I added an infinite terrain
	- The accelerometer moves the jet side to side
	- Pyramids are randomly placed ahead of the jet as the jet moves forward
	- Collision detection is added and if that event occurs, the game is over

Open the project in unity. You can play the game on unity itself by clicking the play button, but since this is a
mobile game, you need the accelerometer to move the plane sideways.
In order to use the phone's accerlerometer follow these steps:
	- Download unity remote on your mobile device
	- Once downloaded, open the unity remote app on the mobile device
	- Connect the mobile device to the computer
	- Press play on unity on the desktop while the unity remote app is running on the mobile device
	- After a few seconds, the app should be displayed on the mobile device and the accelerometer should be working when you tilt the phone which moves the jet in the game
	- the quality of the game won't be good since you are running it in real time using this method

I have only tested this on an iPhone 6
